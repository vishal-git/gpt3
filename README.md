This repository contains some examples for how proprietary text data can be used with GPT-3 to answer questions from it. The first example uses 2020 Summer Olympics data from Wikipedia. This data came into existence _after_ the training period of GPT-3, so it doesn't know answers about that event. The example shows how we can scrape the data from Wikipedia, prepare it, and then pass it to GPT-3 API to get reliable and accurate answers. Many utility functions in this Notebook comes from the OpenAI's wonderful repository: [openai-cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook) The second example shows how we can use proprietary reviews data in a similar fashion. Please note that the reviews dataset is not included with this repository.
